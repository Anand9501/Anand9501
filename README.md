## About Me
I am a senior research fellow at IIITA's Department of Information Technology.   I am a keen learner and my research interests broadly lie in the field of security. During my PhD, I explored and investigated microarchitectural vulnerabilities in the IoT devices. I have 2 publications in Top Tier-A ranked conferences in CSE and one publication in IEEE embedded systems Letters.  In addition to volunteering at conferences such as VLSID, I have taken part in a number of conferences and workshops. I also took part in a PHD forum in the CASES conference and visited Germany to present.  I am very much interested in teaching Operating System, Data structure, C programming, and IoT. I have qualified GATE in 2017 and I am also awardee of MHRD fellowship from 2017 which gave me the opportunity to work as Teaching Assistant. I hold a graduate degree in CET from Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar  and a postgraduate M.TECH with a focus in Human Computer Interaction from IIITA. 
Currently, I am working as an Assistant Professor in the depatment of computer science at Galgotias College of Engineering and Technology.

You can find my publications below.
