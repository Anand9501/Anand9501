 ## Project Experience
 
## Project Title : Power Aware Compiler for Embedded Processors Sponsored by Ministry of Human Resource and Development, Govt. of India, under the IMPRINT India Program (2022)
Topic: A Genetic Algorithm Approach for LLVM Compiler Flag Selection

Details: Determining the best set of flags that will improve power for that particular program. This intelligent selection of compilation flags can be posed as an optimization problem as we are either choosing or leaving the flag by turning it on/off. We used a genetic algorithm approach to determine a combination of flags that could be used to generate optimized code in terms of power efficiency.

Programming Language: Python

## July 2018- Dec 2018 (During M.Tech)

## Course: Virtual Reality
Title: Virtual Walk-through of Museum Using Unity3D and Interaction with Objects

Details: Created a virtual museum using Unity 3D in which users can move around the museum and hear sound effects when they reach particular artifacts, can pick up artifacts,
etc. We also created our own models using Blender.

Software: Unity3D

## Course: Information Retrieval System
Details: Representing Collections of Documents - how to represent, identify, and process the collection of documents. User-initiated querying - understanding, and processing of
the queries. Retrieval of the appropriate documents - the searching mechanism used to obtain and retrieve the relevant documents.

Programming Language: Python

## Summer Project Title: Enhancing User Involvement and Experience by Providing Interactive Tools Using Mixed Reality (Android and Web Application) (May 2018- Aug 2018 )
Details: A Mixed Reality Environment was provided to the visitor in the Museum such that it enhances their experiences by providing different options related to the artifacts and also the user is involved in that environment as they are able to visualize the object from different directions.

Software: Unity3D, Regard3D

## B.Tech Final Year Project (Jan 2017- July 2017) 
Title: Nearby Android Application

Details: Nearby app was built to make it easy for users to locate a business that is within their GPS signal radius. The app locates all such businesses and merchants that are
registered with Google and displays them on the userâ€™s Android device screen. Searching for a particular entry on the internet and then filtering the results takes a lot of time,
nearby does that all on its own by displaying all businesses close to a userâ€™s location at any time.

Programming Language: Java, Android
